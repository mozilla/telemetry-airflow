### shredder

#### Description

These jobs normally need to be restarted many times, because each query is only
attempted once per run. `main_v4` and `main_summary_v4` in particular have partitions
that fail often due to a combination of size, schema, and clustering. In most cases
failed jobs may simply be restarted.

Logs from failed runs are not available in airflow, because Kubernetes Pods are deleted
on exit. Instead, logs can be found in Google Cloud Logging:
- [shredder-flat-rate-main-summary](https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/Tv68VKpCR9fzbJNGA)
- [shredder-flat-rate](https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/Uu6VRn34VY4AryGJ9)
- [on-demand](https://cloudlogging.app.goo.gl/GX1GM9hwZMENNnnq8)

Kubernetes Pods are deleted on exit to prevent multiple running instances. Multiple
running instances will submit redundant queries, because state is only read at the start
of each run. This may cause queries to timeout because only a few may be run in parallel
while the rest are queued.
